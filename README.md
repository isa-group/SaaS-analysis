# "Racing the Market: An Industry Support Analysis for Pricing-Driven DevOps in SaaS": The Laboratory Package

The aim of this repository is to centralize the work performed by the authors to write the paper: "Racing the Market: An Industry Support Analysis for Pricing-Driven DevOps in SaaS" for ICSOC 2024 about the current status of SaaS pricings.

## Available SaaS

The SaaS of the following table are the ones that have been used in the original paper. The following symbols are used to indicate the status of the SaaS for the indicated year:

- ✅: The SaaS is modeled for the indicated year.
- ✖️: There is a snapshot, but a clear feature list cannot be extracted.
- ❌: There isn't a snapshot for the SaaS in the indicated year.

## Structure

The repository contains four main folders:
- `data`
- `figures`
- `pricings`
- `scripts`

In addition, there is a `requirements.txt` file that contains the dependencies needed to run the scripts, a `LICENSE` file that contains the license of the repository, a `README.md` file that contains the information of the repository, and a `analysis_and_figures.ipynb` notebook that contains the full analysis methods used for the original paper and the figures generated by it. Lastly, there is a `technical_report.pdf` file that contains the technical report of the original paper.

### Data

The data folder contains three csv files:
- `pricings_dataset.csv`: Contains the list of SaaS that have been modeled and the urls used to extract the info.
- `saas_pricingplans_normalized.csv`: Contains the normalized data of the pricing plans of the SaaS. It is generated by the notebook `analysis_and_figures.ipynb`.
- `saas_pricingplans.csv`: Contains the raw data of the pricing plans of the SaaS. It is also generated by the notebook `analysis_and_figures.ipynb`.

### Figures
This folder contains the figures generated by the notebook `analysis_and_figures.ipynb`.

### Pricings
This folder contains the pricings of the SaaS that have been modeled. The folder contains a subfolder for each year, and each subfolder contains the pricings of the SaaS for that year. There is also a subfolder called `extras` that contains the pricings of antoher SaaS that were modeled as part of another research: https://zenodo.org/records/10292553.

### Scripts
This folder contains the scripts used by the notebook `analysis_and_figures.ipynb` to generate the data and the figures of the original paper.

## Usage

### Install Dependencies
Dependencies can be installed using the following command: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Scripts
> [!WARNING]
> The notebook is designed to be run with Python 3.9 or higher.

The scripts can be run by following the notebook `analysis_and_figures.ipynb`. The notebook contains the full analysis methods used for the original paper and the figures generated by it.
