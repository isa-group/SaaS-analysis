This pricing sets a default value for the `feature2usageLimit` usage limit, which is linked to `feature2`, but the latter is only available fo the `PRO` plan.

In a real-world example, if `feature2` availability depends on the value of its usage limit, a user subscribed to the plan `BASIC` would have access to `feature2`.
